# Part 1: Instruction

1. Click the button on the bottom of the page and wait the music to start. 

# Part 2: Details of my individual approach to animating the group code.

1. I chose audio to use the level or frequency content of an audio track to animate my group work.
2. The wavyline on the background will be animated to move with the music. The rhythm will create unique effect as the stroke of the lines is continuously changing and the scale is changing which are different to my group members.

The inspiration came from the Aboriginal art, as I want to present the moves of the wave. The scaling of the wave should be changed through the background music.

I also got inspiration from week 11 tutorial on Canvas, as it taught me how to load a sound file and play back.

# Part 4: Technical explanation
I preloaded a sound file as the background music, and then added a button to play or pause. Then I used amplitude analyzer to measure the volume of the music, to animate the size and the stroke of the wavy lines in the background.
